#McPik Basics

## Synopsis

McPik Basics is a template for a WordPress plugin based on Piklist. It has a small library of generally useful add-ons. 

You will need some familiarity with Piklist to make good use of this plugin. 

## Motivation

I found myself using these Piklist parts on most of the websites I've been building, and wanted a centralized repository. I'll be adding more parts as I need new functionality. 

## Organization

The plugin includes four Piklist add-ons: for Options, Rules, Shortcodes, and Widgets. Each can be individually activated using the Piklist > Add-Ons settings. 

## Installation

* Copy the mcpik-basics folder to your WordPress plugins folder. As with all Piklist plugins, each add-on contains a parts/ folder. You probably don't need all the parts for every project. So look in the parts/ folders, delete the ones you don't need and edit the rest as desired. 
* If you haven't already, install and activate [Piklist](https://wordpress.org/plugins/piklist/). 
* Activate McPik Basics. 
* Go to Piklist > Add-Ons and activate any or all of the McPik Basics add-ons.
